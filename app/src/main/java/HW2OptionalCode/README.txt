There is no starter code for this assignment.  However, this CustomElement class and its two subclasses 
may be helpful.  You are under no obligation to use this code or even look at it.  Instances of these
classes could be used to store each element of your drawing.  You will probably need to add additional
subclasses of CustomElement.
